    "\n",
    "- Both **subqueries** and **table expressions** are methods for being able to write a query that creates a table, and then write a query that interacts with this newly created table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes the question you are trying to answer doesn't have an answer when working directly with existing tables in database. However, if we were able to create new tables from the existing tables, we know we could query these new tables to answer our question. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - The original query goes in the FROM statement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - An * is used in the SELECT statement to pull all of the data from the original query.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - You MUST use an alias for the table you nest within the outer query.\n",

    "###  Using subquery in logical statement\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For WHERE, HAVING, or even SELECT - the value could be nested within a CASE statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - You should not include an alias when you write a subquery in a conditional statement. This is because the subquery is treated as an individual value (or set of values in the IN case) rather than as a table.\n",
