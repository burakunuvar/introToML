    "### BASIC SQL STATEMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT** and **FROM**\n",
    "  - Those are required clauses for any statement \n",
    "  - SQL is case-insensitive, ';' is required at the end of each statement for \"MySQL\" but not mandatory for \"PostgreSQL\"\n",
    "  -  The LIMIT statement is useful when you want to see just the first few rows of a table. If you are using the `LIMIT` statement, it will always appear last\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **ORDER BY**    \n",
    "  - Always comes in a query after the SELECT and FROM statements, before the LIMIT \n",
    "  - DESC can be added after the column in your ORDER BY statement to sort in descending order\n",
    "  - Default behaviour is to sort in ascending order.\n",
    "  - When you provide a list of columns in an ORDER BY command, the sorting occurs using the leftmost column in your list first, then the next column from the left, and so on\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **WHERE**\n",
    "  - Common symbols used in WHERE statements include:\n",
    "  - `>` (greater than) `<` (less than)\n",
    "  - `>=` (greater than or equal to) `<=` (less than or equal to)\n",
    "  - `=` (equal to) `!=` (not equal to)\n",
    "  - This statement can also be used with non-numeric data ( we use the `LIKE`, `NOT`, or `IN` operators ) \n",
    "  - SQL requires single-quotes, not double-quotes, around text values `WHERE sample_column_name= 'Sample' ` \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Code** \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "    SELECT * \n",
    "    FROM table_name\n",
    "    ORDER BY column_name1,column_name2\n",
    "    WHERE condition\n",

    "### Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "- **Derived Column**\n",
    " - new column that is a combination of existing columns (aka \"calculated\" or \"computed\" column ) \n",
    " - mathematical operators : `*` (Multiplication) `+` (Addition) `-` (Subtraction) `/` (Division)\n",
    " - use `AS` to define new column name \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Sample Code** \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "     SELECT (standard_usd/total_usd)*100 AS std_percent \n",
    "     FROM orders\n",
    "     LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LIKE \n",
    " - This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.\n",
    " - requires \"wild cards\" in form of `%` ; to represent a character or a number of characters \n",
    " - for Postgres you will need to use single quotes for the text you pass to the `LIKE` operator\n",
    " - So lower and uppercase letters are not the same within the string\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE name LIKE '%one%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. IN\n",
    " - This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.\n",
    " - Check one, two or many column values to pull data,  all within the same query\n",
    " \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT name, primary_poc, sales_rep_id\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE name IN ('Walmart', 'Target', 'Nordstrom');\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "3. NOT\n",
    " - This is used with IN and LIKE to select all of the rows NOT LIKE or NOT IN a certain condition.\n",
    " - Comes before and provides Inverse Results for `IN`, `LIKE` and similar operators\n",
    " \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM web_events\n",
    "WHERE channel NOT IN ('organic', 'adwords');\n",

    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE name NOT LIKE '%one%';\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. AND & BETWEEN\n",
    " - These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.\n",
    " - `AND` operator runs two seperate filters so prefer `BETWEEN` whene filtering the same column for different parts\n",
    " - the BETWEEN operator in SQL is inclusive; that is, the endpoint values are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM web_events\n",
    "WHERE channel IN ('organic', 'adwords') AND occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'\n",
    "ORDER BY occurred_at DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Reminder:** While `BETWEEN` is generally inclusive of endpoints, it assumes the time is at 00:00:00 (i.e. midnight) for dates\n",
    "\n",
    "5. OR\n",
    " - This allow you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.\n",
    " - arithmetic operators (+, *, -, /), and logical operators ( LIKE, IN, NOT, AND, and BETWEEN ) can all be linked   \n",
    "   together using the OR operator.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "```SQL \n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM accounts\n",
    "WHERE (name LIKE 'C%' OR name LIKE 'W%') \n",
    "           AND ((primary_poc LIKE '%ana%' OR primary_poc LIKE '%Ana%') \n",
    "           AND primary_poc NOT LIKE '%eana%')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. IS\n",
    " - Mostly used with `NULL` ; since Null is not a value but a property of data prefer `IS` instead of `=`\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Sample Code** \n",
    " \n",
    "```SQL\n",
