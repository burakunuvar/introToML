    "## Window Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "- [a window function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/tutorial-window.html) performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kind of row based approach to aggregation, row by row display for each step of calculation \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can’t use window functions and standard aggregations in the same query. More specifically, you can’t include window functions in a GROUP BY clause\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <u> Partition By and Order BY </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Order BY defines the frequency of aggregation ( like one calculation for each time_at)  whereas Partition BY splits the table into groups ( like accounts ) \n",
    "\n",
    "- This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities\n",
    "\n",
    "- Window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  - Not every window function uses PARTITION BY; we can also use ORDER BY or no statement at all depending on the query we want to run\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The ORDER BY clause is one of two clauses integral to window functions. The ORDER and PARTITION define what is referred to as the “window”—the ordered subset of data over which calculations are made. Removing ORDER BY just leaves an unordered partition; in our query's case, each column's value is simply an aggregation (e.g., sum, count, average, minimum, or maximum) of all the standard_qty values in its respective account_id.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The easiest way to think about this - leaving the ORDER BY out is equivalent to \"ordering\" in a way that all rows in the partition are \"equal\" to each other. Indeed, you can get the same effect by explicitly adding the ORDER BY clause like this: ORDER BY 0 (or \"order by\" any constant expression), or even, more emphatically, ORDER BY NULL.\n",
