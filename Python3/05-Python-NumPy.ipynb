    "- **NumPy** stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. \n",
    "  - build on top of C programming language, which works at a lower level\n",
    "  - has multidimensional array data structures that can represent vectors and matrices.\n",
    "  - has a large number of optimized built-in mathematical functions\n",
    "- When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations.\n",
    "- NumPy is optimized for matrix operations and it allows us to do Linear Algebra operations effectively and efficiently - making it very suitable for solving machine learning problems.\n",
    "- In fact, NumPy has become so popular that a lot of Python packages, such as Pandas, are built on top of NumPy\n",

    " - `nd` stands for n-dimensional. An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type. In other words, an ndarray is a grid that can take on many shapes and can hold either numbers or strings\n",
    " - There are several ways to create ndarrays in NumPy : \n",

    "- **NDARRAY ATTRIBUTES** The shape of an array is the size along each of its dimensions. NumPy ndarrays have attributes that allow us to get information \n",

    "\n",
    "- **UPCASTING:** When mixed types are used to build an ndarray; since all the elements of an ndarray must be of the same type, NumPy upcasts the integers to floats in order to avoid losing precision in numerical computations.\n",
